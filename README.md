# Udacity_DataAnalyst
 This is a project work I did for the **Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree**
 
## Project 1 - Global Weather Trends 
In this project, I have analysed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends with where I live to overall global temperatures using R.
 
## Project 3 - Analyze A/B Test Analysis

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that we get some practice working with the difficulties of these

For this project, I have worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to work through this  to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
